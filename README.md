The main purpose for my website is to showcase the work that I have accomplished in this composing digital media course to potential employers. I plan on adding detailed descriptions below both of my individual projects that will demonstrate the wide variety of skills I used in order to accomplish them. The descriptions will also explain the background to each project as well as their separate rhetoricals goals. I'm also planning on expanding my "about me" page that will give employers a more detailed background on my undergraduate eduaction, major, work experience, and professional skills. I will also highlight my HTML on my "about me" page and explain that I constructed this website all by myself. I already have my website well laid out, but I welcome any suggestions or areas of improvement.
