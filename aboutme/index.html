   <p class="main-text">Hi everyone! My name is Neal Golightly, and I'm majoring in media and professional communications at the University of Pittsburgh, focusing on corporate and community relations. The corporate/community relations track taught me how to facilitate professional communication with company stakeholders, whether they are customers, the general public, or investors. My communications degree also showed me the wide variety of careers that might be available upon graduation. As I continued with my communications degree, I grew fascinated by professional writing, graphic design, HTML, and CSS. As a matter of fact, I built and designed this website using the HTML and CSS skills that I learned from my composing digital media course. As part of my major, I had to find and complete a mandatory summer internship in order to graduate this December. I successfully completed my summer internship at the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. I assisted the food bank's marketing and communications department on several projects involving media relations, social media, research, archiving photos and videos, and internal communications. Although my summer internship was a lot of hard work, it was at the food bank where I discovered my passion for effective internal communications. Internal communication's purpose is to provide an effective flow of information between an organization's departments and colleagues. This applies both up and down the management/employee chain. It also works among employees who are interacting with each other in the company. With a career in internal communications, I hope to make sure everyone is well-informed and feels like a valued and contributing member of a company or organization regardless of their seniority.  Here you can learn more about my composing digital media projects. Feel free to explore my web portfolio to see what might peak your interest.
