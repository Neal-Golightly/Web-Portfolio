   <p>Soundscape Project</p>
   <p class="main-text">I named my soundscape narrative “Afterthought” because I decided later on to add inner monologue as I was creating my day in the life soundscape narrative. I also chose to call my soundscape narrative “Afterthought” because I believed that my project would be more interesting if I verbally expressed my daily thoughts and feelings alongside my daily routine. I also wanted to make my day in the life soundscape narrative different from my everyone else in my class by sharing my thoughts and feelings about subject matters that I think about regularly. Initially, I was not going to include an inner monologue. However, as I listened to my soundscape with just sound effects it seemed too bare bones and basic. I also wanted to include a few more sound effects, such as a clip of foreign languages for the bus ride and the sound of a classroom, but the feedback of my classmates suggested that my soundscape narrative was already too long. I did not entirely agree because my soundscape narrative was only slightly over four minutes, but I took their advice. I understand that sounds are just as expressive as words are, but I wanted to include my inner monologue so that my listeners could have something to relate to. I also wanted to include my daily thoughts because I believe the sound effects that I chose combined with my inner monologue complement each other while also keeping the narrative element intact within my soundscape.
Throughout the entire duration of my soundscape narrative project, I always kept in mind the perspectives that my listeners might have towards my soundscape narrative. Another reason why I chose to add my inner monologue alongside my sound effects is because I wanted listeners to have as close of a day in the life experience as possible without it getting weird. A technical challenge that I experienced during the creation of my soundscape narrative was timing and aligning my inner monologue recording with all the sequential sound effects that I used. I found myself rerecording my inner monologue part several times because I wanted my thoughts and feelings to continuously flow accordingly alongside my sound effects to make my soundscape a more enjoyable experience. After numerous attempts, I finally created an inner monologue recording that fits in with the rest of my sound effects.
According to Ken Jordan’s excerpt in “Sound Unbound”, “The tools we have at our disposal to make art carry consequences for the art we make” (250). I believe this statement is incredibly accurate and true because the tools we use to make art have an undeniable influence on the art we produce. The tools we used to create our soundscape narratives, such as audacity and various sound effects, play a significant role in determining the end result of our final art creations. I enjoyed learning about audacity and creating my soundscape narrative.
